# GCP-Cloud-Run-Golang-App

In this project, I have successfully implemented a containerized Golang application deployment on the Cloud Run platform. I achieved this by configuring continuous deployment, which involves establishing a linkage between the Github repository and Cloud Source Repositories. Furthermore, I integrated a Cloud Build Trigger into the process to automatically generate and deploy updated docker images to Cloud Run. To enhance the project's accessibility and usability, I leveraged Google Domains to create and assign a custom domain name to the application.

## Architecture Breakdown

The application is broken down into the architecture below:
